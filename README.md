## About

We've built this API during the Rocketseat NLW event, in which we learned the basics of backend development with Elixir and Phoenix framework.

On the first day, we learned the basics of Elixir, the Phoenix Framework and functional programming, like pattern matching, immutability or how Phoenix handle request and responses.

We also learned how Elixir connects to and manipulates the database using Ecto and how to create and read entities in our database.

After that, we had an introductory lesson on GraphQL and how to use it in Phoenix with Absinthe.
